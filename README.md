# Roblox Engine: Comprehensive Plan of Services, Controllers, and Modules

This document enumerates **all planned systems** in the engine—**services**, **controllers**, and **modules**—based on previously discussed features. The overall goal is to provide a **drop-in framework** that auto-initializes on both the client and server, offering robust functionality out of the box.

---

## 1. Services

Services are **major, server-focused** components (though some may have a shared or client-facing portion). Each service typically manages a critical domain like data, security, or networking. They’re initialized on the server by default, but some may expose remotes or shared code for the client.

### 1.1 DataService
- **Purpose**: Load, save, and cache player data; manage DataStore usage.  
- **Key Features**:  
  - **Schema & Migration**: Defines default data schemas (e.g., `coins`, `inventory`) and upgrades old data to new versions.  
  - **Caching & Throttling**: Maintains an in-memory cache of player data to reduce DataStore calls; retries on throttles.  
  - **MemoryStore / MessagingService Integration** *(Optional)*: Publishes real-time updates to other servers for cross-server data sync.  
  - **PlayerDataController** (sub-controller): Helper for retrieving, setting, and versioning individual player data.  
  - **EconomyController** (sub-controller): Manages currency transactions, logs suspicious changes, and can communicate with SecurityService.

### 1.2 NetworkService
- **Purpose**: Streamline client-server communication with automatically created RemoteEvents/RemoteFunctions.  
- **Key Features**:  
  - **Auto Remote Creation**: Scans for “network endpoints” in services or modules, auto-generates remotes.  
  - **Parameter Validation & Rate Limiting**: Prevents exploiters from spamming or sending malicious data.  
  - **EventDispatcher** (sub-module): Publish/subscribe system for cross-service communication.  
  - **ClientAPIController** (sub-module): Defines typed methods for client calls (e.g., `NetworkService:CallClient("UpdateUI", data)`).

### 1.3 LoggingService
- **Purpose**: Central hub for logging info, warnings, and errors on both server and client.  
- **Key Features**:  
  - **Unified Logging Methods**: `LogInfo()`, `LogWarn()`, `LogError()`, each supporting structured data.  
  - **DebugConsoleController** (sub-controller): In-game command console for admins/devs to run engine commands or inspect logs.  
  - **AnalyticsController** (sub-controller, optional)**: Sends logs/analytics to external endpoints or tracks custom metrics in-game.

### 1.4 SecurityService
- **Purpose**: Provide server-side validation, anti-exploit checks, and optional data obfuscation.  
- **Key Features**:  
  - **AntiCheatController**: Checks for rapid currency changes, repeated suspicious remote calls, etc.  
  - **RateLimitController**: Throttles or temporarily bans IP/player for extreme event spam.  
  - **EncryptionHelper**: Light hashing or obfuscation for sensitive data fields.  
  - **ModeratorTools**: Hooks for banning, kicking, or logging suspect user behavior.

### 1.5 AnalyticsService *(Optional / May Merge With LoggingService)*
- **Purpose**: Focus on funnel tracking, user behavior, and game metrics.  
- **Key Features**:  
  - **Event Tracking**: `AnalyticsService:TrackEvent("PurchaseMade", { item = "Sword", cost = 100 })`.  
  - **Session Data**: Summaries of session length, average spend, or conversion rates.  
  - **External API Integration**: Option to send data to 3rd party analytics (like PlayFab, Google Analytics, etc.).

### 1.6 EconomyService *(Optional, Alternatively a Sub-Module of DataService)*
- **Purpose**: Centralize currency transactions, game passes, dev product handling, and subscription logic.  
- **Key Features**:  
  - **GamePassManager**: Checks ownership, handles purchase flow.  
  - **DevProductManager**: Processes one-time or consumable dev product purchases; auto-saves outcomes.  
  - **SubscriptionManager**: Tracks recurring VIP or membership states.  
  - **Transaction Logging**: Logs all financial events to prevent exploitation and track revenue stats.

### 1.7 VoiceService *(Optional / Future)*
- **Purpose**: Handle advanced voice features like zones or transformations.  
- **Key Features**:  
  - **VoiceZoneController**: Mutes/unmutes or volumes up/down players based on location or grouping.  
  - **VoiceEffectsController** *(Optional)*: Real-time voice filters for thematic or comedic effect.

### 1.8 SocialService *(Optional / Future)*
- **Purpose**: Manage clan/guild systems, friend parties, and matchmaking.  
- **Key Features**:  
  - **ClanGuildController**: Create or join groups, store shared data, handle ranks/roles.  
  - **PartySystemController**: Form “parties” of friends for group queueing or cross-server migration.  
  - **Cross-Server Chat** *(Optional)*: Ties in with MemoryStore/MessagingService for global or clan chat.

### 1.9 SchedulerService *(Optional)*
- **Purpose**: Provide timed or recurring tasks beyond manual `while wait()` loops.  
- **Key Features**:  
  - **Cron-Like Scheduling**: e.g., run a function every hour or daily resets.  
  - **Scripted Events**: Time-based triggers for special in-game events or announcements.

### 1.10 EnvironmentService *(Optional)*
- **Purpose**: Distinguish between dev, staging, and production environments.  
- **Key Features**:  
  - **EnvironmentManager**: Chooses which DataStore keys or analytics endpoints to use.  
  - **Configurable Logging**: Dev environment logs everything, production logs only errors.

## 2. Controllers (Primarily Client-Side or Shared)

Controllers are often **local (client) scripts** or modules that focus on **player-centric features**—UI interactions, input, camera, etc. Some controllers may also have server logic if needed.

### 2.1 UIController
- **Purpose**: Orchestrate all UI screens, popups, and transitions on the client.  
- **Key Features**:  
  - **TagBinder** (sub-controller): Scans for GUI objects tagged with “Button” or “Screen” and auto-binds logic.  
  - **TransitionManager** (sub-controller): Standardized fade, slide, or scale transitions for opening/closing panels.  
  - **Data Binding** *(Optional Advanced)*: Automatic updates to text or elements when player data changes.

### 2.2 CameraController
- **Purpose**: Manage custom cameras (top-down, first-person, etc.) and transitions.  
- **Key Features**:  
  - **FreeCam / FollowCam** setups.  
  - Smooth transitions or advanced camera scripting (shake, zoom).  
  - Possibly integrated with user input for rotating or toggling views.

### 2.3 InputController

- **Key Features**:  
  - **Background Tracks**: Start/stop music based on game state or location.  
  - **SFX Triggering**: Play short clips for UI clicks, pickups, or environment triggers.  
  - **3D Sound**: Adjust volume/panning based on distance to the source.

### 2.5 DebugController *(Optional)* 
- **Purpose**: Client-side debugging overlay or commands.  
- **Key Features**:  
  - **On-Screen Stats**: FPS, memory usage, or custom game metrics.  
  - **Admin Commands**: Trigger server or client test methods (requires LoggingService or SecurityService integration).

## 3. Modules (Feature-Specific Systems)

Modules are **specialized libraries** or sub-systems that can be loaded by either **services** or **controllers**. They don’t typically run on their own; they provide functionality that the rest of the engine uses.

### 3.1 Gameplay Modules

1. **QuestModule**  
   - Track quest objectives, progression, and rewards.  
   - Integrates with DataService to save states, with UIController for a quest log UI.
2. **AchievementModule**  
   - Manages unlocking achievements, awarding badges, or points.  
   - Ties into DataService for persistence and UIController for notifications.
3. **NPC/AI Module**  
   - Provides pathfinding, state machines, or behavior trees for NPC logic.  
   - Could connect to SecurityService (e.g., for verifying AI data if manipulations are possible).
4. **ECS (Entity-Component System)** *(Advanced)*  
   - A more flexible approach to define game entities (players, NPCs, items) with components (Health, Movement, AI).  
   - Not mandatory, but powerful for large or dynamic projects.

### 3.2 Monetization Modules

1. **GamePassModule**  
   - Logic for verifying ownership, purchasing passes, awarding post-purchase benefits.  
   - Typically used by EconomyService or DataService to store purchase states.
2. **DevProductModule**  
   - Processes consumable or one-time purchases with relevant callbacks.  
   - Integrates with DataService for saving purchased items or currency increments.
3. **SubscriptionModule**  
   - Recurring membership or VIP-like features that require a time-based or indefinite status.  
   - Ties into DataService to store subscription info.

### 3.3 Social & Voice Modules

1. **VoiceZoneModule**  
   - Facilitates voice channels or “zones” that automatically adjust mic settings based on location or group.  
   - Optionally interacts with UIController for on-screen indicators.
2. **Clan/GuildModule**  
   - CRUD operations for clan creation, invites, ranks, and data storage.  
   - Integrates with SocialService if present, or directly with DataService.
3. **PartySystemModule**  
   - Allows players to form parties, share data, or queue for matchmaking together.  
   - Could incorporate cross-server chat or advanced notifications.

### 3.4 Security & Anti-Exploit Modules

1. **EncryptionHelper**  
   - Simple hashing or obfuscation for sensitive data (e.g., unique tokens).  
   - Ties into SecurityService to pass hashed values around.
2. **ModeratorTools**  
   - Basic interface or commands to ban/kick or watch suspicious activity.  
   - Possibly used by LoggingService to store ban logs.

### 3.5 World/Environment Modules *(Optional)*

1. **SceneStreamingModule**  
   - Loads/unloads terrain or parts for large open-world games.  
   - Interacts with DataService if certain areas unlock after progression or achievements.
2. **LocalizationModule**  
   - Facilitates multi-language support.  
   - Hooks into UIController to swap text strings dynamically.
3. **ThemingModule**  
   - Provides color palettes, fonts, or UI styles that can be swapped or updated globally.

### 3.6 Utility Modules

1. **TableUtil / StringUtil**  
   - Common table manipulation, deep copies, string formatting, etc.  
2. **Signal / Event Emitter**  
   - Internal utility for binding and firing signals if you don’t want to rely purely on Roblox events.  
3. **Types Module**  
   - Shared type definitions for data structures (e.g., `PlayerData`, `QuestEntry`) used across the engine.

---

## 4. Auto-Initialization & Packaging

1. **Single Folder**  
   - All services, controllers, and modules reside under `Framework` (or your chosen name).  
   - Includes two key scripts: `InitServer` and `InitClient` that run automatically when placed in the correct locations.
2. **Server & Client Bootstrap**  
   - **InitServer**: Discovers and starts all server services (e.g., DataService, SecurityService).  
   - **InitClient**: Loads client controllers (UIController, CameraController, etc.) and any shared or local modules needed on the client.
3. **Configuration File**  
   - A single Lua table (e.g., `GlobalSettings.lua`) controlling feature flags, environment modes, toggles for optional modules.  
   - Example:  
     ```lua
     return {
       AntiCheatEnabled = true,
       VoiceChatEnhancements = false,
       Environment = "Production"
     }
     ```
4. **No Extra Setup**  
   - Drag the folder into your game, place the server and client init scripts (or let the framework create them automatically), and everything registers.

---

## 5. Putting It All Together: Example Flow

1. **Server Launch**  
   - `InitServer` requires each service (DataService, NetworkService, etc.) in the correct order.  
   - DataService sets up caching and schema definitions; NetworkService registers RemoteEvents.  
   - SecurityService listens for suspicious events, LoggingService logs the startup.

2. **Player Joins**  
   - DataService loads the player’s data from DataStore or memory cache.  
   - UIController on the client shows the main menu (tag-based UI binding).  
   - EconomyService checks for game pass ownership, subscription status, etc.

3. **Gameplay**  
   - Player interacts with UI, calls remote functions (NetworkService validates calls).  
   - Data changes (e.g., awarding coins) are saved in DataService.  
   - AchievementModule sees new coin totals, checks for unlocks, updates the UI with a notification.

4. **Player Leaves**  
   - DataService saves final data.  
   - LoggingService records session-end logs.  
   - The engine cleans up any leftover references to the player.

## 7. Conclusion

By outlining **every planned service, controller, and module**, you have a **comprehensive blueprint** for an easily packaged, auto-initializing Roblox engine. You can **mix and match** which features you need for a particular project, toggling them in your configuration file. The typed approach, combined with explicit sub-controllers for each domain, ensures **maintainable**, **scalable**, and **secure** gameplay experiences.

Feel free to adapt, rename, or reorganize these components as you see fit—this plan is meant to be a flexible foundation for **any** Roblox game that requires robust networking, data handling, UI flows, monetization, and beyond.
